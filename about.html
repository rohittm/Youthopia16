							I am very happy to note that DIT University is organizing Youthopia 2016, as a part of its annual Techno Cultural Festival during 20 – 22 October, 2016. Teaching and learning process through a well laid curriculum structure would not be complete unless and until students apply their knowledge to find innovative applications in various disciplines of engineering, science, architecture and pharmacy. Technical Festivals of this kind provide the right platform for the student community to exhibit their talent and involve in a healthy competition. Cultural events add more colour to the feast of knowledge showcased by the participants, providing an electrifying atmosphere and make us feel that learning is fun. The members of the Organizing Committee of Youthopia – 2016 have done a wonderful job in bringing together a number of students from institutes far and wide, along with reputed professionals, giving the students a unique opportunity to expose their talents, learn from each other and also prepare them to face the rigors of professional life.

							Putting thoughts into actions seems to be a more arduous task than using the gift of the gab. But when you put thoughts to actions, you see a side of yourself that doesn’t otherwise reveal itself in conversation or thoughts.
On behalf of the entire students, staff and faculty of DIT University I am pleased to present you  a platform where you can  use your ‘gifts’ and  talents to the best of your abilities. We present to you YOUTHOPIA’16- a techno – cultural fest which aims  to promote interaction amongst students and explore  talents from all over the country.
<br>This fest not only serves as an attempt to put the various events together but also focuses on enriching the students’ experience to make them dynamic. In fact, the fest promises something for everyone.
<br>To meet an essential need of students at this stage, Youthopia’16 will give them an unparalleled opportunity to form new bonds and  celebrate our cherished cultures  through the  confluence of a very diverse crowd. The fest’16 will see some amazing performances and will definitely ignite a spark in students and performers to initiate actions which might go on to brighten the world.<br><br>
